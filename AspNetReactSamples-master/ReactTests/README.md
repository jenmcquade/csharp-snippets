# ReactTests has been removed

If you arrived here then it is via an old link, as ReactTests has been removed and has become 
part of the 
[ReactWebPack.CoreRC2](https://github.com/JonPSmith/AspNetReactSamples/tree/master/ReactWebPack.CoreRC2) 
project.

I initially set up the React Unit Tests as a separate project, but this proved to be a mistake.
The problem is being seperate from the code it was testing can cause a 
[multiple copies of React](https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner) 
error in some cases. 

Please have a look at the top-level [README file](https://github.com/JonPSmith/AspNetReactSamples)
for more information on the Unit Tests and articles.
