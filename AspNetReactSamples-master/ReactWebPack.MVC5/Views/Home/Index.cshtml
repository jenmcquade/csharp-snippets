    This is an ASP.NET MVC5 web site using <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> code which was built by
    <a href="http://webpack.github.io/docs/">WebPack</a>
    with <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel js</a> doing the transpiling.
</h3>
<p>
    This application was downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/pro-react/kanban-app/tree/chapter6">Pro React GitHub, Chapter 6</a>
    with a small change to the file <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/AspNetReactSamples/blob/master/ReactWebPack.MVC5/app/api/KanbanApi.js">KanBanApi.js</a>
    to get data from this MVC application.
    <br/>
    Note: this React application uses <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> store,
    while the <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/AspNetReactSamples/tree/master/ReactWebPack.CoreRC2">ReactWebPack.CoreRC2</a>
    uses the <a href="http://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>.
