<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>"<em>An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no 
conceptual identity is called a VALUE OBJECT.</em>" (Eric Evans).</p>
	<p>As opposite to <a href="Entities.html">Entities</a>, which have their 
	identities (Id), a Value Object has not it's identity. If identities of two 
	Entities are different, they are considered as different objects/entities 
	even if all other properties of those entities are same. Think two different 
	persons have same Name, Surname and Age but they are different people if 
	their identity numbers are different. But, for an Address (which is a 
	classic Value Object) class, if two addresses has same Country, City, Street 
	number... etc. they are considered as the same address.</p>
	<p>In Domain Driven Design (DDD), Value Object is another type of domain 
	object which can include business logic and is an essential part of the 
	domain.</p>
	<h3>Value Object Base Class</h3>
	<p>ABP has a <strong>ValueObject&lt;T&gt;</strong> base class which can be inherited 
	in order to easily create Value Object types. Example <strong>Address</strong> 
	Value Object type:</p>
	<pre lang="cs">public class Address : <strong>ValueObject&lt;Address&gt;</strong>
{
    public Guid CityId { get; private set; } //A reference to a City entity.

    public string Street { get; private set; }

    public int Number { get; private set; }

    public Address(Guid cityId, string street, int number)
    {
        CityId = cityId;
        Street = street;
        Number = number;
    }
}</pre>
	<p>ValueObject base class overrides equality operator (and other related 
	operator and methods) to compare two value object and assumes that they are 
	identical if all properties are identical. So, all of these tests pass:</p>
	<pre lang="cs">var address1 = new Address(new Guid(&quot;21C67A65-ED5A-4512-AA29-66308FAAB5AF&quot;), &quot;Baris Manco Street&quot;, 42);
var address2 = new Address(new Guid(&quot;21C67A65-ED5A-4512-AA29-66308FAAB5AF&quot;), &quot;Baris Manco Street&quot;, 42);

Assert.Equal(address1, address2);
Assert.Equal(address1.GetHashCode(), address2.GetHashCode());
Assert.True(address1 == address2);
Assert.False(address1 != address2);</pre>
	<p>Even they are different objects in memory, they are identical for our 
	domain.</p>
	<h3>Best Practices</h3>
	<p>Here, some best practices for Value Objects:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Design a value object as <strong>immutable</strong> (as like the 
		Address above) if there is not a very good reason for designing it as 
		mutable.</li>
		<li>The properties that make up a Value Object should form a conceptual 
		whole. For example, CityId, Street and Number shouldn't be serarate 
		properties of a Person entity. Also, this makes Person entity simpler.</li>
	</ul>
