			<h3 id="DocIntro">Introduction</h3>
			<p>We are creating different applications based on different needs. 
But implementing common and similar structures over and over again, at 
least in some level. <strong>Authorization</strong>, <strong>Validation</strong>, 
				<strong>Exception Handling</strong>, <strong>Logging</strong>, <strong>Localization</strong>, 
				<strong>Database Connection Management</strong>, <strong>Setting Management</strong>, 
				<strong>Audit Logging</strong> are some of these common structures. Also, we 
are building <strong>architectural structures</strong> and <strong>best practices</strong> like
				<strong>Layered </strong>and <strong>Modular </strong>Architecture, <strong>Domain Driven Design</strong>, 
				<strong>Dependency Injection </strong>and so on. And trying to 
develop applications based on some <strong>conventions</strong>.</p>
			<p>Since all of these are very time-consuming and hard to build seperately for 
every project, many companies 
create private <strong>frameworks</strong>. They're developing new applications 
faster with less bugs using these frameworks. Surely, not all companies that 
lucky. Most of them have no <strong>time</strong>, <strong>budget</strong> and
				<strong>team</strong> to develop such frameworks. Even they have possibility to 
create a framework, it's hard to <strong>document</strong>, <strong>train 
developers</strong> and <strong>maintain</strong> it.</p>

			<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate (ABP) is an <strong>open source and well documented 
application framework </strong>started idea of "developing a <strong>common
				</strong>framework for all companies and all developers!" It's not just a 
framework but also provides a strong <strong>architectural model</strong> based 
on <strong>Domain Driven Design</strong> and <strong>best practices</strong> in 
mind.</p>

			<h3 id="DocQuickSample">A Quick Sample</h3>
			<p>Let's investigate a simple class to see ABP's benefits:</p>
			<pre lang="cs">public class TaskAppService : ApplicationService, ITaskAppService
{
    private readonly IRepository&lt;Task&gt; _taskRepository;

    public TaskAppService(IRepository&lt;Task&gt; taskRepository)
    {
        _taskRepository = taskRepository;
    }

    [AbpAuthorize(MyPermissions.UpdatingTasks)]
    public async Task UpdateTask(UpdateTaskInput input)
    {
        Logger.Info(&quot;Updating a task for input: &quot; + input);

        var task = await _taskRepository.FirstOrDefaultAsync(input.TaskId);
        if (task == null)
        {
            throw new UserFriendlyException(L(&quot;CouldNotFoundTheTask<span lang="tr">Message</span>&quot;));
        }

        input.MapTo(task);
    }
}</pre>
			<p>Here, we see a sample <a href="/Pages/Documents/Application-Services">
Application Service</a> method. An application service, in DDD, is directly used 
by presentation layer to perform <strong>use cases</strong> of the application. 
We can think that <strong>UpdateTask </strong>method is called by javascript via 
AJAX. Let's see ABP's some benefits here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dependency-Injection">Dependency 
	Injection</a>
					</strong>: ABP uses and provides a strong and conventional DI 
	infrastructure. Since this class is an application service, it's 
	conventionally registered to DI container as transient (created per 
	request). It can simply inject all dependencies (as IRepository&lt;Task&gt; in 
	this sample).</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Repositories">Repository</a>
					</strong>: 
	ABP can create a default repository for each entity (as IRepository&lt;Task&gt; in 
	this example). Default repository has many useful methods as FirstOrDefault 
	used in this example. We can easily extend default repository upon our 
	needs. Repositories abstracts DBMS and ORMs and simplifies data access 
	logic.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Authorization">Authorization</a>
					</strong>: 
	ABP can check permissions. It prevents access to UpdateTask method if 
	current user has no "updating task" permission or not logged in. It 
	simplifies authorization using declarative attributes but also has 
	additional ways of authorization.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects">
	Validation</a>
					</strong>: ABP automatically checks if input is null. It also 
	validates all properties of an input based on standard data annotation 
	attributes and custom validation rules. If request is not valid, it throws a 
	proper validation exception.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Audit-Logging">Audit Logging</a>
					</strong>: 
	User, browser, IP address, calling service, method, parameters, calling 
	time, execution duration and some other informations are automatically saved 
	for each request based on conventions and configurations.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Unit-Of-Work">
						<strong>Unit Of Work</strong>
					</a>: 
	In ABP, each application service method is assumed as a unit of work as 
	default. It automatically creates a connection and begins a transaction at 
	the beggining of the method. If the method successfully completed without 
	exception, then the transaction is commited and connection is disposed. Even 
	this method uses different repositories or methods, all of them will be 
	atomic (transactional). And all changes on entities are automatically saved 
	when transaction is commited. Thus, we don't even need to call 
	_repository.Update(task) method as shown here.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Handling-Exceptions">
						<strong>Exception 
	Handling</strong>
					</a>: We almost never handle exceptions in ABP in a web 
	application. All exceptions are automatically handled by default. If an 
	exception occurs, ABP automatically logs it and returns a proper result to 
	the client. For example, if this is an AJAX request, the it returns a JSON 
	to client indicates that an error occured. If hides actual exception from 
	client unless the exception is a UserFriendlyException as used in this 
	sample. It also understands and handles errors on client side and show 
	appropriate messages to users.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Logging">Logging</a>
					</strong>: As you 
	see, we can write logs using the Logger object defined in base class. 
	Log4Net is used as default but it's changable or configurable.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Localization">Localization</a>
					</strong>: 
	Notice that we used L method while throwing exception. Thus, it's 
	automatically localized based on current user's culture. Surely, we're 
	defining CouldNotFoundTheTask<span lang="tr">Message </span>in somewhere 
	(see <a href="/Pages/Documents/Localization">localization</a> document for more).</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Transfer-Objects">Auto Mapping</a>
					</strong>: 
	In the last line, we're using ABP's MapTo extension method to map input 
	properties to entity properties. It uses AutoMapper library to perform 
	mapping. Thus, we can easily map properties from one object to another based 
	on naming conventions.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API">Dynamic Web API Layer</a>
					</strong>: 
	TaskAppService is a simple class actually (even no need to deliver from 
	ApplicationService). We generally write a wrapper Web API Controller to 
	expose methods to javascript clients. ABP automatically does that on 
	runtime. Thus, we can use application service methods directly from clients.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Dynamic-Web-API#DocDynamicProxy">
	Dynamic Javascript AJAX Proxy</a>
					</strong>: ABP creates javascript proxy 
	methods those make calling application service methods just as simple as 
	calling javascript methods on the client.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We can see benefit of ABP in such a simple class. All these tasks normally 
take significiant time, but all they are automatically handled by ABP.</p>

			<h3 id="DocWhatElse">What Else</h3>
			<p>Beside this simple example, ABP provides a strong infrastructure and 
application model. Here, some other features of ABP:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Module-System">Modularity</a>
					</strong>: 
	Provides a strong infrastructure to build reusable modules.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Data-Filters">Data Filters</a>
					</strong>: 
	Provides automatic data filtering to implement some patterns like 
	soft-delete and multi-tenancy.</li>
				<li>
					<strong><a href="Multi-Tenancy.html">Multi Tenancy</a></strong>: It 
					fully supports multi-tenancy, including single database or 
					database per tenant architectures.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						<a href="/Pages/Documents/Setting-Management">Setting Management</a>
					</strong>: 
	Provides a strong infrastructure to get/change application, tenant and user 
	level settings.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Unit &amp; Integration Testing</strong>: It's built testability in 
	mind. Also provides base classes to simplify unit &amp; integration tests. See
					<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/871786/Unit-testing-in-Csharp-using-xUnit-Entity-Framewor">
	this article</a> for more information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For all features, see <a href="/Pages/Documents">documentation</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="DocStartupTemplate">Startup Templates</h3>
			<p>Starting a new solution, creating layers, installing nuget packages, creating 
a simple layout and a menu... all these are also time consuming stuff.</p>
			<p>ABP provides pre-built
				<a href="http://www.aspnetboilerplate.com/Templates">startup templates</a> that 
makes starting a new solution is much more easier. Templates support <strong>SPA</strong> 
(Single-Page Application) and <strong>MPA</strong> (Multi-Page MVC Applications) 
architectures. Also, allows us to use different ORMs.</p>

			<h3 id="DocHowToUse">How To Use</h3>
			<p>ABP is developed on <strong>
					<a href="https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate">Github</a>
				</strong> and 
distributed on <strong>
					<a href="/Pages/Documents/Nuget-Packages">Nuget</a>
				</strong>. 
Easiest way of starting with ABP is creating a
				<a href="http://www.aspnetboilerplate.com/Templates">startup template</a> and 
following the <a href="/Pages/Documents">documentation</a>.</p>
