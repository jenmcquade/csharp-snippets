<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This document describes ASP.NET Core integration for ASP.NET Boilerplate 
framework. ASP.NET Core integration is implemented in
	<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Abp.AspNetCore" target="_blank">
	Abp.AspNetCore</a> nuget package </p>

        <h4>Migrating to ASP.NET Core?</h4>
        <p>If you have an existing project and considering to migrate to ASP.NET 
		Core, you can read our
		<a href="http://volosoft.com/migrating-from-asp-net-mvc-5x-to-asp-net-core/" target="_blank">
		blog post</a> for our experince on the migration.</p>
      </div>
	<h3>Startup Template</h3>
	<p>You can create your project from <a href="/Templates">startup template</a>, 
	which is a simple, empty web project but properly integrated and configured 
	to work with ABP framework.</p>
	<h3>Configuration</h3>
	<h4>Startup Class</h4>
	<p>To integrate ABP to ASP.NET Core, we should make some changes in the 
	Startup class as shown below:</p>
	<pre lang="cs">public class Startup
{
    public <strong>IServiceProvider</strong> ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        //...

<strong>        //Configure Abp and Dependency Injection. Should be called last.
        return services.AddAbp&lt;MyProjectWebModule&gt;(options =&gt;
        {
            //Configure Log4Net logging (optional)
            options.IocManager.IocContainer.AddFacility&lt;LoggingFacility&gt;(
                f =&gt; f.UseLog4Net().WithConfig(&quot;log4net.config&quot;)
            );
        });
</strong>    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
    {
<strong>        //Initializes ABP framework and all modules. Should be called first.
        app.UseAbp(); 
</strong>        
        //...
    }
}</pre>
	<h4>Module Configuration</h4>
	<p>You can use <a href="Startup-Configuration.html">startup configuration</a> 
	to configure AspNet Core Module (using <em>Configuration.Modules.AbpAspNetCore()</em> 
	in PreInitialize of your module).</p>
	<h3>Controllers</h3>
	<p>Controllers can be any type of classes in ASP.NET Core. It's not 
	restricted to classes derived from Controller class. By default, a class 
	ends with Controller (like ProductController) is considered as MVC 
	Controller. You can also add MVC's [Controller] attribute to any class to 
	make it a controller. This is the way ASP.NET Core MVC is working. See ASP.NET Core <a href="https://docs.asp.net">
	documentation</a> for more.</p>
	<p>If you will use web layer classes (like HttpContext) or return a view, 
	it's better to inherit from <strong>AbpController</strong> (which is derived 
	from MVC's Controller) class. But if you are creating an API controller just 
	works with objects, you can consider to create a POCO controller class or 
	you can use your application services as controllers as described below.</p>
	<h4>Application Services as Controllers</h4>
	<p>ASP.NET Boilerplate provides infrastructure to create
	<a href="Application-Services.html">application services</a>. If you want to 
	expose your application services to remote clients as controllers (as 
	previously done using <a href="Dynamic-Web-API.html">dynamic web api</a>), 
	you can easily do it by a simple configuration in
	<a href="Module-System.html">PreInitialize</a> method of your module. 
	Example:</p>
	<pre lang="cs">Configuration.Modules.AbpAspNetCore().<strong>CreateControllersForAppServices</strong>(typeof(MyApplicationModule).Assembly, moduleName: 'app', useConventionalHttpVerbs: true);</pre>
	<p><strong>CreateControllersForAppServices</strong> method gets an assembly 
	and converts all application services to MVC controllers in that assembly. 
	You can use <strong>RemoteService</strong> attribute to enable/disable it for method or 
	class level.</p>
	<p>When an application service is converted to MVC Controller, it's default 
	route will be like <em>
	/api/services/&lt;module-name&gt;/&lt;service-name&gt;/&lt;method-name&gt;</em>. Example: If 
	ProductAppService defines a Create method, it's URL will be <strong>
	/api/services/app/product/create</strong> (assumed that module name is 
	'app').</p>
	<p>If <strong>useConventionalHttpVerbs</strong> set to <strong>true</strong> 
	(which is the <strong>default value</strong>), then HTTP verbs for service 
	methods are determined by <strong>naming conventions</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Get</strong>: Used if method name starts with 'Get'.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Put</strong>: Used if method name starts with 'Put' or 'Update'.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Delete</strong>: Used if method name starts with 'Delete' or 
	'Remove'.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Post</strong>: Used if method name starts with 'Post', 
	'Create' or 'Insert'.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Patch</strong>: Used if method name starts with 
					'Patch'.</li>
				<li>Otherwise, <strong>Post</strong> is used <strong>as default</strong> 
	HTTP verb.</li>
			</ul>
	<p>You can use any ASP.NET Core attributes to change HTTP methods or routes 
	of the actions (but surely, this requires to add reference to related ASP.NET Core 
	package).</p>
	<p><strong>Note</strong>: Previously, dynamic web api system was requiring 
	to create service <strong>interfaces</strong> for application services. But this is not required for 
	ASP.NET Core integration. Also, MVC attributes should be added to the 
	service classes, even you have interfaces.</p>
	<h3>Filters</h3>
	<p>ABP defines some <strong>pre-built filters</strong> for AspNet Core. All 
	of them are added to <strong>all actions of all controllers</strong> by 
	default.</p>
	<h4>Authorization Filter</h4>
	<p><strong>AbpAuthorizationFilter</strong> is used to integrate to
	<a href="Authorization.html">authorization system</a> and
	<a href="Feature-Management.html">feature system</a>.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can define <strong>AbpMvcAuthorize</strong> attribute for 
		actions or controllers to check 
	desired permissions before action execution.</li>
		<li>You can define <strong>RequiresFeature</strong> attribute for 
		actions or controllers to check desired features before action 
		execution.</li>
		<li>You can define <strong>AllowAnonymous</strong> (or AbpAllowAnonymous 
		in application layer) attribute for actions or controllers to suppress 
		authentication/authorization.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Audit Action Filter</h4>
	<p><strong>AbpAuditActionFilter</strong> is used to integrate to
	<a href="Audit-Logging.html">audit logging system</a>. It logs all requests 
	to all actions by default (if auditing is not disabled). You can control audit logging using <strong>Audited</strong> and <strong>
	DisableAuditing</strong> attributes for actions and controllers.</p>
	<h4>Validation Action Filter</h4>
	<p><strong>AbpValidationActionFilter</strong> is used to integrate to
	<a href="Validating-Data-Transfer-Objects.html">validation system</a> and 
	automatically validate all inputs of all actions. In addition to ABP's 
	built-in validation &amp; normalization, it also checks MVC's <strong>
	Model.IsValid</strong> property and throws validation exception if action 
	inputs have any invalid value.</p>
	<p>You can control validation using <strong>EnableValidation</strong> and
	<strong>DisableValidation</strong> attributes for actions and controllers.</p>
	<h4>Unit of Work Action Filter</h4>
	<p><strong>AbpUowActionFilter</strong> is used to integrate to
	<a href="Unit-Of-Work.html">Unit of Work</a> system. It automatically begins 
	a new unit of work before an action execution and completes unit of work 
	after action exucition (if no exception is thrown).</p>
	<p>You can use <strong>UnitOfWork</strong> attribute to control behaviour of 
	UOW for an action. You can also use startup configuration to change default 
	unit of work attribute for all actions.</p>
	<h4>Exception Filter</h4>
	<p><strong>AbpExceptionFilter</strong> is used to handle exceptions thrown 
	from controller actions. It <strong>handles</strong> and <strong>logs</strong> 
	exceptions and returns <strong>wrapped response</strong> to the client.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It <strong>only handles object results</strong>, not view results. 
		So, actions returns any object, JsonResult or ObjectResult will be 
		handled. Action returns a view or any other result type implements 
		IActionsResult are not handled. It's suggested to use built-in 
		UseExceptionHandler extension method defined in 
		Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagonistics package to handle view exceptions.</li>
		<li>Exception handling and logging behaviour can be changed using
		<strong>WrapResult</strong> and <strong>DontWrapResult</strong> 
		attributes for methods and classes.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Result Filter</h4>
	<p><strong>AbpResultFilter</strong> is mainly used to wrap result action if action 
	is successfully executed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It only wraps results for JsonResult, ObjectResult and any object 
		which does not implement IActionResult (and also their async versions). If your 
		action is returning a view or any other type of result, it's not 
		wrapped.</li>
		<li><strong>WrapResult</strong> and <strong>DontWrapResult</strong> 
		attributes can be used for methods and classes to enable/disable 
		wrapping.</li>
		<li>You can use startup configuration to change default behaviour for 
		result wrapping.</li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Result Caching For Ajax Requests</h5>
	<p>AbpResultFilter adds Cache-Control header (no-cache, no-store) to the 
	response for AJAX Requests. Thus, it prevents browser caching of AJAX 
	responses even for GET requests. This behaviour can be disabled by the 
	configuration.</p>
	<h3>Model Binders</h3>
	<p><strong>AbpDateTimeModelBinder</strong> is used to normalize DateTime 
	(and Nullable&lt;DateTime&gt;) inputs using <strong>Clock.Normalize</strong> 
	method.</p>
	<h3>Views</h3>
	<p>MVC Views can be inherited from <strong>AbpRazorPage</strong> to 
	automatically inject most used infrastructure (LocalizationManager, 
	PermissionChecker, SettingManager... etc.). It also has shortcut methods 
	(like L(...) for localize texts). Startup template inherits it by default.</p>
	<h3>Client Proxies</h3>
	<p>ABP can automatically create javascript proxies for all MVC Controllers 
	(not only application services). 
	It's created for <em>Application Services as Controllers</em> (see the 
	section above) by default. You can add [RemoteService] attribute to any MVC 
	controller to create client proxy for it. Javascript proxies are dynamically 
	generated on runtime. You need to add given script definition to your page:</p>
	<pre lang="xml">&lt;script src=&quot;~/AbpServiceProxies/GetAll?type=jquery&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
	<p>Currently, only JQuery proxies are generated. We can then call an MVC method 
	with javascript as shown below:</p>
	<pre lang="js">
abp.services.app.product.create({
    name: 'My test product',
    price: 99
}).done(function(result){
    //...
});</pre>
	<h3>Integration Testing</h3>
	<p>Integration testing is fairly easy for ASP.NET Core and it's
	<a href="https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/testing/integration-testing.html" target="_blank">
	documented it's own web site</a> in details. ABP follows this guide and 
	provides <strong>AbpAspNetCoreIntegratedTestBase</strong> class in
	<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Abp.AspNetCore.TestBase" target="_blank">
	Abp.AspNetCore.TestBase</a> package. It makes integration testing even 
	easier.</p>
	<p>It's better to start by investigating integration tests in startup 
	template to see it in action.</p>
